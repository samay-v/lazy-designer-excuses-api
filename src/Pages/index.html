        <h2>API documentation</h2>
        <p>The four weeks out of the six passed like nothing, I wrote exactly zero lines. I did go through the Plugin docs and build my bare-bones react app with it, but that was about it. I was sure that I'm not going to build anything.</p>

        <p>Then as we were discussing with my colleagues at Kiwi.com what should be our standard mobile device to design for, we agreed that we should design for the most popular one (ðŸ¤¯), but it was hard to keep track of which devices are popular and where.
            And this is when the idea to have a list of different display sizes with their market share occurred. So I started coding.</p>

        <p>I didn't really think it through. I started coding right away and decided to figure stuff out as I go. I managed to release the plugin, and in the first weeks, it gathered over ten thousand installs. But right after the release, the fall and winter
            of 2019 challenged me both personally and professionally. And I didn't progress at all because of that.
        </p>

        <p>Fortunately, right at the beginning of the new year, I achieved my long dream of going over to Japan, and ride their pow covered hills. I had it on my list for the past eight years. While it was exhausting, and my body was at the edge of its limits,
            my mind was finally able to rest. It was truly an amazing experience.</p>
